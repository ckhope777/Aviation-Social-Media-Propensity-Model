# Aviation-Social-Media-Propensity-Model
Project focuses on building predictive models to identify customers with high propensity to purchase flight tickets, based on their social media behavior. An aviation company that offers domestic and international travel wanted to move away from broad telemarketing campaigns and adopt a digital targeting approach. By collaborating with a social networking platform, they aimed to deliver personalized advertisements directly to users most likely to buy.

The challenge: Customer purchasing patterns differ by device type (Laptop vs. Mobile). Therefore, two separate models were developed to predict ticket purchase propensity.
